# Noughts and Crosses

This is a Python implementation of the classic game Noughts and Crosses. The game supports two different modes: human vs. human and human vs. CPU. Players can choose their preferred mode and enjoy the classic gameplay.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script in your Python environment.
2. Choose the number of players (1 or 2) at the main menu.
3. If playing against the CPU, input the position (1-9) to place your "X" symbol on the board.
4. The CPU will then make its move (placing "O" randomly).
5. The game will continue until there is a winner or the board is full.

## Board Representation

The game board is represented as a list of 9 elements, where each element corresponds to a position on the board. The board is initially filled with "#" characters, and as players make moves, their symbols ("X" or "O") are placed on the board.

## Main Menu

The code provides a main menu that allows the user to select the desired game mode (1 or 2 players). Depending on the choice, the corresponding game mode function is called to start the game.

Please note that this implementation does not include any graphical user interface (GUI) and runs in a console environment.

Enjoy playing Noughts and Crosses!
